This directory expands the ecosystem register one folder at a time. Each page
captures what a DX folder has actually achieved, where the validation lives, and
which wording still needs fresh verification before it can be used publicly.

## Documentation Rules

- Keep one page per folder.
- Prefer current repository-backed validation over chat memory.
- Separate repository-managed status from runtime, hosted, or release status.
- Do not repeat benchmark numbers without naming the report or receipt that owns
  them.

# And in our DX Ecosystem we got these achievements

This register captures what each top-level DX folder contributes to the
ecosystem. It is intentionally validation-based: folder achievements should come
from repository-backed README files, DX handoff notes, manifests, policies, or focused
verification receipts.

This is not a public marketing page. It is the internal canonical map for
turning scattered wins into a coherent DX story.

## Positioning Rules

- Prefer repository-managed validation over promotion.
- Say "implemented" or "repository-managed" when runtime verification is still deferred.
- Do not present full framework parity, runtime-verified status, or release status
  unless the relevant repo has current verification.
- Keep folder achievements short enough that a future worker can update one row
  without rewriting the whole document.
- Link or name the reference set that should be checked before a public wording.

## Core Product

| Folder | Role | Achievement To Preserve | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `code` | DX Code editor surface and Zed-derived fork | repository-level DX editor work has connected release views, Web Preview safety, Agent/Tools/Connections surfaces, semantic icon routing, record-aware panels, and bounded GPUI polish without replacing upstream Zed behavior. | `docs/achievements/code.md`, `code/DX.md`, `code/AGENTS.md`, source guards, `git diff --check`; runtime/native verification is still deferred. |
| `cli` | DX command interface and TUI | The `dx` command is the hub entry point for DX-WWW, Forge, Serializer, Check, tool routing, retained engine workspaces, and the Ratatui shell that should become the regular operator surface. | `docs/achievements/cli.md`, `cli/README.md`, `cli/DX.md`, root `dx` manifest. |
| `www` | Rust-based web framework/runtime | `dx-www` owns a React/Next-familiar TSX authoring model while keeping routing, static/no-JS output, micro-runtime interactivity, client islands, package governance, style, icon, check, build, and deploy validation inside DX-managed code. | `docs/achievements/www.md`, `www/README.md`, `www/AGENTS.md`, `www/DX.md`, Forge importer tests, route-handler and state-runtime guards. |

## Agent And Orchestration Layer

| Folder | Role | Achievement To Preserve | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agent` | Rust-first agent runtime | Preserves provider routing, memory, gateway pairing, cron, skills, session tooling, desktop support, and maintainable CLI contracts while exposing DX-branded public surfaces. | `docs/achievements/agent.md`, `agent/README.md`, `agent/DX.md`. |
| `driven` | AI-assisted development orchestrator | Consolidates multi-editor AI rule formats and DX worker coordination work into Rust-based parsing, emitting, templating, context analysis, sync, validation, steering, hooks, receipts, and durable handoffs. | `docs/achievements/driven.md`, `driven/src/lib.rs`, `driven/src/strategy/receipt.rs`, `driven/tests/strategy_contract_tests.rs`; older performance wording needs fresh verification. |
| `flow` | Local-first AI input/runtime layer | Defines the local activation, dictation, text refinement, low-end model routing, and safe host-control layer that can plug into desktop, mobile, Tauri, Flutter, browser/WASM, and editor hosts. | `docs/achievements/flow.md`, `flow/README.md`. |
| `extensions` | Host extension workspace | Keeps official host adapters repository-managed through typed manifests, registry validation, source guards, package/preflight receipts, host-discovery reporting, and release validation gates instead of copying DX logic into each host. | `docs/achievements/extensions.md`, `extensions/registry/official-extensions.toml`, `extensions/registry/release-evidence-gates.toml`, `extensions/.dx/receipts/extensions/progress-latest.json`; loaded-host and release-qualified wording remain unproven. |
| `dcp` | Development Context Protocol | Explores a binary-first protocol path with fixed headers, capability negotiation, MCP/JSON-RPC compatibility, signed dispatch, replay/redaction guards, transports, observability, and SDK surfaces. | `docs/achievements/dcp.md`, `dcp/README.md`, `dcp/src/lib.rs`, `dcp/tests/props/*.rs`; performance/security wording needs current focused test and benchmark verification. |
| `providers` | AI provider catalog | Catalogs provider/model data, runtime adapters, auth requirements, aliases, exposure statuses, and generated metadata so DX can reason about AI access through one repository-managed interface. | `docs/achievements/providers.md`, `providers/README.md`, `providers/data/provider-metadata.generated.json`, `providers/src/catalog_archive.rs`; live-provider wording needs fresh auth/network verification. |

## DX Tool Engines

| Folder | Role | Achievement To Preserve | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `check` | Validation engine | Turns source-health, adapter safety, rule-pack provenance, generated-artifact boundaries, and web-audit validation into Rust-based scoring, diagnostics, and receipts. | `docs/achievements/check.md`, `check/Cargo.toml`, `check/dx`, `check/docs/check/*.md`, `check/tests/*.rs`. |
| `forge` | Code and media version-control layer | Extends the DX source-control story beyond normal Git by tracking code, media, assets, project files, remotes, receipts, and package validation. | `docs/achievements/forge.md`, `forge/README.md`, `forge/docs/FORGE_STATUS.md`. |
| `serializer` | Token-optimized serializer | Demonstrates typed `.machine` data as a real runtime path, with repo-documented savings versus JSON and mmap validation/hot-read performance verification. | `docs/achievements/serializer.md`, `serializer/README.md`; keep benchmark context with any public numbers. |
| `style` | Rust-based CSS scanner/generator | Gives DX-WWW a Tailwind-familiar generated CSS workflow with theme-token strictness and no local PostCSS dependency chain for the release path. | `docs/achievements/style.md`, `style/README.md`; do not present full Tailwind parity until guards prove it. |
| `i18n` | Localization, TTS, and STT | Combines auth-free local status, lockfile, and run workflows with JSON/Markdown buckets, protected placeholders and structure, optional Lingo.dev-compatible HTTP execution, and TTS/STT source modules. | `docs/achievements/i18n.md`, `i18n/docs/LINGO_DEV_COMPAT.md`, `i18n/src/localization/*.rs`, `i18n/tests/localization_cli.rs`; embedded model and live-provider wording needs fresh verification. |
| `icon` | Icon search and catalog layer | Provides a Rust-based icon search surface with 229 local pack files, zstd-compressed index artifacts, CLI search/export/download commands, optional web routes, and optional WASM support. | `docs/achievements/icon.md`, `icon/data/*.json`, `icon/index/*.zst`, `icon/src/bin/icon.rs`, `icon/src/bin/web.rs`; benchmark and bulk-download wording needs fresh verification. |
| `media` | Media processing toolkit | Catalogs provider-backed, direct-url, local, feature-gated, external-dependency, credential-backed, and declared media tools with source kind, status, route, receipt, provenance, and type-validation metadata. | `docs/achievements/media.md`, `media/README.md`, `media/src/tools/registry.rs`, `media/tests/tool_receipt_tests.rs`, `media --format json tools list`. |
| `metasearch` | Search engine registry/server/CLI | Organizes reusable query/result types, engine adapters, Axum server endpoints, OpenSearch, cache, coalescing, health tracking, provider access models, status probes, and CLI release into one Rust workspace. | `docs/achievements/metasearch.md`, `metasearch/README.md`, `metasearch/docs/PROVIDER_ACCESS_MODELS.md`, `metasearch/crates/metasearch-server/src/routes/health.rs`; live-provider wording needs fresh probes. |

## Language And Upstream-Derived Workspaces

| Folder | Role | Achievement To Preserve | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `py` | Python acceleration and package-manager research hub | Coordinates CPython workstream worktrees, package-manager research, benchmark tooling, manifests, receipts, and reports without flattening embedded repos into one giant Git root or overstating native-JIT speed. | `docs/achievements/py.md`, `py/README.md`, `py/manifests/workspace-repositories.json`, `py/artifacts/reports/python-speed-comparison-20260530-074441.md`. |
| `build` | Upstream-derived build tooling workspace | Keeps Rolldown/build-system research available with an opt-in `.machine` cache design, validated metadata reads, package-json cache integration, and governed benchmark receipt policy. | `docs/achievements/build.md`, `build/meta/design/dx-machine-cache.md`, `build/crates/rolldown_utils/src/dx_machine_cache.rs`, `build/packages/bench/receipt/source-receipt.ts`; speed wording needs a current executed receipt. |
| `js` | Upstream-derived JavaScript runtime workspace | Keeps Bun/runtime research available with a scoped package-metadata `.machine` cache experiment, same-binary local JSON versus local machine benchmark validation, and DX contract scripts. | `docs/achievements/js.md`, `js/PLAN.md`, `js/.tmp/dx-local-json-vs-machine-benchmark-summary.md`, `js/scripts/dx-local-json-vs-machine-benchmark.ts`; benchmark wording is fixture-local, not full runtime wording. |
| `native` | Upstream-derived native app workspace | Keeps Tauri/native-shell research available through default-off DX serializer `.machine` caches, read-only timing mode, mmap coverage, command/helper benchmark receipts, and release-boundary guards. | `docs/achievements/native.md`, `native/README.md`, `native/PLAN.md`, `native/crates/tauri-cli/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`; product-wide speed and default-on wording remain blocked. |

## Hub And Operations

| Folder | Role | Achievement To Preserve | References |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.dx` | Runtime state and receipts | Stores local receipts, caches, archive metadata, smoke outputs, and repository-level archive manifests outside the source payload. | `.dx/source-archives`, `.dx/receipts`; intentionally not source. |
| `.github` | GitHub configuration parking area | Documents that Actions are paused and keeps workflow files disabled until CI is explicitly reopened. | `.github/workflows/README.md`, `docs/policies/ci-policy.md`. |
| `docs` | Hub policy and decision record | Holds source-control, CI, artifact, archive, backup, restore, and maintainability policy so DX has operating memory outside chat. | `docs/policies/*.md`, `docs/policies/maintainability-baseline.json`. |
| `scripts` | Hub audit and safety automation | Provides read-only or manifest-first scripts for folder audits, maintainability checks, archive manifests, artifact inventory, and backup-exclusion testing. | `scripts/*.ps1`. |
| `tools` | Auxiliary external tool payloads | Keeps bulky external payloads such as Playwright browser engines, screenshot-helper dependencies, Turso database CLI material, and Turso cloud CLI binaries/completions in a separate LFS-backed tools repo. | `docs/achievements/tools.md`, `tools/.gitattributes`, `tools/node-screenshot/package.json`, `tools/turso-cli/README.md`; keep binaries and generated payloads out of source archive wording. |
| `trash` | Quarantine/archive area | Preserves removed or parked work without deleting it while the ecosystem is being consolidated. | Archive manifests should be written before deleting or moving anything here. |

## Current Storyline

DX is becoming a local-first development platform:

1. `zed` is the editor surface.
2. `cli` is the command and TUI control plane.
3. `www` is the repository-managed web framework/runtime.
4. `agent`, `flow`, `providers`, and `extensions` connect AI, input, and host surfaces.
5. `forge`, `check`, `serializer`, `style`, `icon`, `media`, `metasearch`, and `i18n` make the toolchain repository-managed instead of dependency-owned.
6. `py`, `build`, `js`, and `native` keep production-focused upstream/runtime research available without turning the hub into a monorepo.

The strongest positioning today is not "everything is release-qualified." The stronger,
more professional positioning is: DX now has a coherent set of repository-managed tools,
forks, receipts, archive rules, and verification paths that can be promoted
folder by folder into release-grade products.
